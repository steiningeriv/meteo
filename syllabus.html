            The midterms and final will consist primarily of (short) essay and short answer questions and they
            are comprehensive in nature, although at least half of Exam II and the final will cover material
            taught since the previous test. Make-ups may be scheduled at the instructor's convenience for
            reasonable absences. The make-up should be taken before the scheduled exam time, if at all possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            To encourage reading of the assigned material and class participation, note that quizzes compose a
            large part of the final grade. Quizzes may be announced, but usually will be a surprise. They will
            generally be multiple choice or short answer questions that deal with the current material. Please
            be sure to bring a pencil or pen and some (preferably loose-leaf) paper to class, and don't be late!
            Traditionally, there have been NO make-up opportunities for the in-class quizzes. However, I will
            allow quiz make-ups at my convenience- normally during office hours or just before or after class if
            there is time. Quizzes must be completed before the next class period or there will be no credit.
            Brief notes will be posted on the Web and/or Canvas but they in no way are meant as a substitute for
            regular attendance. The moral- come to class. Note, however, that the extra credit available is the
            equivalent of about four missed quizzes, so if you miss a quiz you shouldn't be worried as long as
            you’re willing to do a little extra work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note also that the laboratory assignments are worth a third of your total grade.
            Lab assignments are due at the beginning of Friday’s class, with few exceptions!
            Again, if you are unable to attend because of an emergency, tell the TA as soon as
            possible and get the assignment- we cannot accept assignments once the next lab begins (a week late).

            One source of extra credit is the highly recommended semester project. This project is designed to
            raise your level of consciousness regarding the environment in which we live. You will write a
            meteorological diary (how does the weather affect you?) which will be kept in a (recommended) 3-by-5
            memo notebook. Carry it with you, especially when you go outdoors and make at least three entries
            per week, but each day can count for no more than one entry. Keep each entry relatively short, maybe
            filling one side of a 3-by-5 page, unless you just can't help yourself. Entries might cover interesting
            weather conditions of the day, a special meteorological phenomenon or "oddity," a weather reference
            from another course or a stapled-in copy of a weather cartoon or news report from that day about
            significant weather or a weather-related tragedy (with your personal comments). Let it be personal,
            original and creative. <b>Simply, for example, stapling in the daily forecast or reporting the temperature
                will not earn you any credit.</b> There is a deduction for less than 50 entries and no additional credit
            for more than 50 entries, so plan on 50 good ones! You’ll cover a greater range of weather if you plan
            to write one entry every other day - 3 to 4 per week.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will also include a weather forecasting component as extra credit; there will be more details about
            this during class. You are encouraged to read (online) Chapter 17 and do some research to improve your
            forecast accuracy. Feel free to talk with me about anything, preferably during office hours, but
            appointments are welcome, too!

        <p>
            The Pennsylvania State University is a community dedicated to personal and academic excellence.
            The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope our students,
            faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the University is strongly
            committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University
            policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal
            freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles,
            thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them,
            and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>I will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community.</b> The University
            is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all
            individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or
            intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean
            the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination,
            taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by
            striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors
            that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their
            academic goals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>I will practice academic integrity.</b> Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all
            academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open,
            honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice
            integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of
            falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the
            fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work
            completed by others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>I will demonstrate social and personal responsibility.</b> The University is a community
            that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable.
            Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against
            people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental
            health of members of the community. I will exercise personal responsibility for my actions
            and I will make sure that my actions do not interfere with the academic and social environment
            of the University. I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of
            Conduct and respecting the rights of others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>I will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies.</b>
            The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information
            needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume
            final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation
            requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my
            educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the
            University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing
