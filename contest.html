      <h2>Welcome to the weather forecasting contest page for Meteo 3.</h2>
      <h3 class="spacer">A brief overview of the rules is included below.  If you have any problems, comments or
suggestions, send them to me, please: <a href="mailto:wjs1@psu.edu">Bill Syrett (wjs1@psu.edu)</a>. <br>Thank you.  Happy forecasting!</h3> <br>
      <h3 class="spacer">Forecasting Contest Rules and Information</h3>
      <p>Forecasting begins after class on October 20 and ends on December 6, with a week off at Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Practice period is done.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You will be entering a high temperature and low temperature forecast
        for Tuesdays and Thursdays for State College (at the airport) by going
        to the web site below and entering your username and password. Your
        contest username is your Penn State "email" ID, like xyz1234
        (don't add the @psu.edu) and your forecasting contest password is
        "Meteo3" (without the quotes) followed immediately by the last 4 digits
        of your PSU ID (on your card).<b>Your password is NOT the same one you
          use on your PSU account (I can't know your password)!</b> If you lose
          your card your ID number / contest password will not change to your new
          number. You may use any forecasting aids you'd like, but the forecast
          must be entered BEFORE 00z of that day. This means that a Tuesday forecast
          will be due before Monday at 8pm (or 7pm when Daylight Saving Time ends)
          and a Thursday forecast will be due before 8/7 pm Wednesdays. It is a
          good idea to enter forecasts for the next two dates each time, so if
          you forget the next one at least you'll get credit for a forecast. You
          may enter as many times as you wish before the deadline- the final entry
          will be used as your forecast. We will verify data by using observed
          temperatures at the University Park Airport from midnight to midnight
          local time. The forecaster with the most points will win the contest,
          and one point is subtracted for each degree your forecast is off from
          the observed high and low. The maximum lost points for a day is 20
          (10 each for the high and the low). We will tabulate both the earned
          points and the number of completed forecasts. Treat this as a 50-point
          assignment. If you complete all forecasts you'll get full credit. If
          you win the contest you'll get extra credit, as shown below. Good luck!
        </p>
      <h3 class="spacer">Scoring: How You Will Earn Extra Credit Points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 points for each completed forecast, up to 50 points (12 forecasts)</li>
        <li>20 additional points if final average score beats Syrett (8 forecast minimum)</li>
        <li>30 additional points if final total score beats Syrett</li>
        <li>First-place student receives 10 additional points, or 25 additional
        points if they also win the contest</li>
      </ul>
